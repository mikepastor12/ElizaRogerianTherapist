Second generation of the famous MIT artificial intelligence example

#  WORK - IN - PROGRESS !
Overview of the Next Generation Eliza program

The original Eliza program was a pioneer in the development of Artificial Intelligence software.   Deployed by MIT University in 1964 to simulate a human interaction with a Rogerian therapist, it provided hope for the future of today's AI robots.  I created a C/Unix version of Eliza in 1991 and hope to advance this concept today.

The Next Generation of Eliza moves away from the 'list-based' logic of responses and utilizes a Tensorflow Neural Network.  Voice interaction will be much improved with Cloud based services in a Python environment.   A further step will be to deploy Eliza on a Raspberry PI robot so Eliza can follow you around the room...
