#       Build the next generation of the famous Eliza program.
#       Eliza simulates a Rogerian Therapist with basic reflections.
#       Eliza was one of the first AI programs introduced in the 1960s.
#       I implemented a version of Eliza using C language in early 1990s
#           and build on some of those ideas here...
